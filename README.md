# Final_Project

### Selected Topic:
- Our selected topic entails using machine learning to predict future stock prices based on historical data. The machine learning model will take in stock data and will from the last three years and will output prediction prices of the S&P 500. Our dataset conatins the monthly stock price of the S&P 500 dating back to 1960.

### Reason we selected the topic:
- We selected this topic due to our interest in the stock market and desire to create a machine learning model that could potentially predict market trends based on previous performance data. 

- We wanted to predict something relevant to the our economy. After analyzing various data sets, we decided we wanted to better understand the S&P 500. We each picked an individual sector with a stock in the   S&P 500 of interest to learn more about.


### Description of the source of data:
- Daily starting and ending price of the S&P 500 from 2019.

- Daily prices for our handpicked stocks from 2019:
    (Apple, Nike, Kellogg, Occidental Petroleum, and C.H. Robinson)

- Daily prices for their individual sectors: 
(Tech, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Energy, Industrials)


### Questions we hope to answer with the data:
- We hope to find out if it is possible to create a machine learning model that can accurately predict stock prices. Specifically, we want to find out if we can accurately predict the S&P 500 over a certain period of time. 

Question : How accurately can we predict stock prices based on our created machine learning models?

- Another question we want to answer is if there is a relationship between historical trends and future stock performance.

Question: Is there a relationship between historical trends and future stock performance?

### Communication Protocls
- Our group outlined some standard communication protocols. For any infromation relvant to the whole group, we deliberate through our group slack channel. If there is smiething specific between two members, then the members reach out to each other through slcak via direct message.
