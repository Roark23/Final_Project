# Final_Project

# Overview

A storyboard of our project will be used to display our data findings from our dataset that conatins the monthly stock price of the S&P 500 dating back to 1960.

# Results

We have hand picked 5 companies
   - Apple
   - CH Robinson
   - Kellog
   - Nike
   - Occidental Petroleum

## This tools are the best fit for Our project

* Git Hub:
   - Is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git, plus its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features 

* Visual Studio Code:
   - Is a source-code editor that we used with a variety of programming languages, including Python. It is based on the Electron framework,    which   is used to develop  Web applications that run on the Blink layout engine.

* Kaggle:
   - Is an online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners. Kaggle allowed us to find our data sets for this project

* Phyton 3:
   - functions are reusable, ordered chunk of code that performs the single, connected activity. Functions provide our program with more modularity and allow us to reuse a lot of code

* SQL Database:
   - SQL, is short for Structured Query Language, is a database programming language for querying and editing information

* Quick DBD - www.quickdatabasediagrams.com: 
   - Starting the build of the database, we are using the same ERD program used in class, the Quick DBD

# Summary

Here is presented a description of Tools and their functionality in this project to help our audience to better understand the application of them.
Data where pulled from Pandas for a trail run of the Machine Learning Model.
Plots have been created to present visualizations of the closing price for the selected companies, and distribution of the dataset as well.
Data is splitted into Train and Test DataSet, 80% Training Data and 20% Testing Data.
The Machine Learning Model will run a linear regression, ARIMA model, and a Facebook Prophet model.

- limitations of these models will be that they do not take into account current world situations (like COVID impacts on economy)
