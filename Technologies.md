## Data Cleaning and Analysis

Data cleansing involves spotting and resolving potential data inconsistencies or errors to improve our data quality.
In this process, we review, analyze, detect, modify, or remove “dirty” data to make our dataset “clean.” Data clesing 
is also called data cleaning or data scrubbing.

The way we check for unique values is to use the Pandas DataFrame's 

Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage

Selecting the right data store for our requirements is a key design decision. Reason why we have decided to use
SQL as an standard language for accessing and manipulating databases, which provides various benefits to our development, 
such as saving time by automating routine tasks, locating and fixing errors, taking advantage of intelligent support from 
the IDE, and increasing overall productivity.


## Machine Learning

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that we learn, and gradually improving its accuracy. Through the use of statistical methods, algorithms are trained to make classifications or predictions, uncovering key insights within our data mining project. Also, The Evaluation metric measures the quality of the machine learning model. ideally impacting key growth metrics.

The machine learning aspect will take in stock data from the last three years of the dataset and will output prediction prices. The code will run two different forecasting models (ARIMA and Facebook Prophet) and will produce graphs displaying the predictions to compare each of the models.

## Dashboard

An Excel dashboard is a place where we are going to track all our important indicators, metrics, and data points
using visuals and charts.

This Dashboard will giveus a high-level view of how this 5 business are doing and help us make snap decisions based on data.

Here we are presenting an Analytical Dashboard that will help us save time in the analysis and presentation of our data
