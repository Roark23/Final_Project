## Data Cleaning and Analysis

Data cleansing involves spotting and resolving potential data inconsistencies or errors to improve our data quality.
In this process, we review, analyze, detect, modify, or remove “dirty” data to make our dataset “clean.” Data clesing 
is also called data cleaning or data scrubbing.

The way we check for unique values is to use the Pandas DataFrame's 

Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage

Selecting the right data store for our requirements is a key design decision. Reason why we have decided to use
SQL as an standard language for accessing and manipulating databases, which provides various benefits to our development, 
such as saving time by automating routine tasks, locating and fixing errors, taking advantage of intelligent support from 
the IDE, and increasing overall productivity.


## Machine Learning

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.

The machine learning aspect will take in stock data and will from the last three years and will output prediction prices. The code will run two different forecasting models (ARIMA and Facebook Prophet) and will produce graphs displaying the predictions to compare each of the models.

evaluation metric, which measures the quality of the machine learning model. 

Machine learning is an important component of the growing field of data science. Through the use of statistical methods, algorithms are trained to make classifications or predictions, uncovering key insights within data mining projects. These insights subsequently drive decision making within applications and businesses, ideally impacting key growth metrics.

"SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is ___. Extra ML verbiage here."


## Dashboard

A dashboard is a related group of interactive scorecard and report views that are organized together in a SharePoint or Web-hosted site.

"In addition to using a Flask template, we will also integrate D3.js for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. It will be hosted on ___."
