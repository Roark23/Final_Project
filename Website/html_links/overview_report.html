After analyzing various data sets, we decided we wanted to better understand the S&P 500. We each picked an individual sector and a corresponding stock in the S&P 500 to compute analysis and predictions over </p><br><h3> Data Exploration </h3><p> The data contains daily closing prices of the S&P 500 from 2019 to 2020. The data was then broken down into an individual sector and a corresponding stock. These were: </p><ul><li> energy Sector: occidential </li><li> Consumer Staples Sector: Kellogg </li><li> Consumer Discretionary Sector: Nike </li><li> Energy Sector: Occidential Petroleum </li><li> Industrials Sector: CH Robinson <li></ul><p> Then to get a better understanding of the data three charts were made: a linear graph of the stock/sectors daily closing price history, a trend/seasonlity plot, and a distribution plot. These can be seen with descriptions on the corresponding stock/sector pages. </p><br><h3> Data Analysis </h3><p> Our Selected topic entails using Machine Learning to predict future stock prices based on historical data. The Machine Learning models will take in stock data from the last three years to output prediction prices of the S&P 500. The models utilied were:</p><ul><li> Linear Regression: The purpose of viewing the linear regression model was to see how closely correlated each companyâ€™s stock or industry was related to the S&P (i.e. if the S&P increased would the company or industry also increase). </li><li> ARIMA: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average. This is a statistical model that attempts to use past observations of the target variable to forecast its future values. Some limitations to the ARIMA model is that it has difficulty predicting turning points, it struggles with seasonality, and it performs well on short term forecasts but has poorer performance long term. </li><li> Facebook Prophet: The Facebook Prophet model is an additive regression model (like the ARIMA) but it includes growth trend and seasonal components. Some limitations of the Prophet model are it has a tendency to overfit the data, and it requires data to be in a specific format. </li></ul>
